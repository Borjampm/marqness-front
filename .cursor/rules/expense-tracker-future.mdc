# Expense Tracker Development Guidelines

## Current State

Currently contains only [ExpenseTracker.tsx](mdc:src/components/expense-tracker/ExpenseTracker.tsx) showing "under construction" message.

## Future Component Structure

When implementing the expense tracker, follow these patterns based on the hobby tracker structure:

### Core Components (Planned)
```
src/components/expense-tracker/
├── ExpenseTrackerApp.tsx     # Main app with providers (like HobbyTrackerApp)
├── ExpenseView.tsx           # Main expense entry interface
├── ExpenseHistory.tsx        # Expense history and management (like Activities)
├── ExpenseDashboard.tsx      # Analytics and insights (like Dashboard)  
├── ExpenseSettings.tsx       # Categories and preferences (like Settings)
├── ExpenseNavbar.tsx         # Navigation bar (like Navbar)
└── modals/
    ├── ExpenseModal.tsx      # Edit expenses (like ActivityModal)
    └── ExpenseForm.tsx       # Add new expenses (like MetadataForm)
```

### Service Integration
Follow the same service pattern as hobby tracker:
```typescript
// Future services to create
import { ExpenseService } from '../../services/expenseService';
import { ExpenseCategoryService } from '../../services/expenseCategoryService';
import { ReceiptService } from '../../services/receiptService';
```

### Context Usage
```typescript
// Future contexts to create
import { ExpenseProvider } from '../../contexts/ExpenseContext';
```

## Design Principles

1. **Consistency**: Follow hobby tracker patterns for similar functionality
2. **Independence**: Expense tracker should be self-contained in its folder
3. **Shared Components**: Reuse [AuthGuard](mdc:src/components/shared/AuthGuard.tsx), [Navbar](mdc:src/components/shared/Navbar.tsx) when appropriate
4. **Services**: Create expense-specific services following existing patterns
5. **Import Paths**: Use same `../../` pattern for services, contexts, and lib

## Current Under Construction

The current [ExpenseTracker.tsx](mdc:src/components/expense-tracker/ExpenseTracker.tsx) serves as a placeholder showing planned features and navigation back to working apps.
