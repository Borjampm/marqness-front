Frontend Feature Tracker

## Project Context

This React-based front-end is part of a simple time-tracking MVP application with Supabase backend and PostgreSQL database. The core user flow is:
	1.	Start: User presses the "Start" button to begin timing an activity. A new entry is created in the database.
	2.	Stop: User presses the "Stop" button to end timing. The app pauses the timer and opens a metadata form.
	3.	Metadata: User provides a Name (required), Description (optional), and Category (optional). The form submits to complete the entry.
	4.	Save: The completed entry is saved in the database, and the UI resets for a new timing session.

**Tech Stack:** React 18 + TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, React Context + Hooks, React Hook Form, Supabase, ESLint, Prettier.
